## What?
Libraries for converting BibTeX files to HTML formatted data in different programming languages.

## Why?
This repository will be showcasing the capabilities of the different programming languages.
This means that it will grow with time. Moreover, it will be mostly empty for a while
because I will be practising and honing my skills in different programming languages.

In alphabetical order:
* Bash (using plain *nix tools)
* C
* C++
* Java
* JavaScript
