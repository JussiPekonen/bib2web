bib2web
========

## What?
Libraries for converting BibTeX files to web formatted data (HTML & JSON) in
different programming languages.

## Why?
Because I'm a LaTeX geek and want to play with the file and string processing
capabilities of different programming languages. This means this repository will
contain really bad code, but because it's mine, I don't care. But if you find it
useful for some weird reason, feel free to use my code (see the copyright and
forking section in the end of this README).

Because I'm playing with different programming languages, this repository will
grow with time. However, it will be mostly empty for a while because I have also
other things to do and my skills in all listed programming languages require
some practice firstâ€¦

## Dependencies

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is used for building/bundling the libraries. The
language-specific dependencies can be found in the README.md file of the
corresponding directory.

## Implementations

### Done:

None.

### Planned:

In alphabetical (and most likely in implementation) order:
* Bash (using plain *nix tools)
* C
* C++
* Java
* JavaScript
* Kotlin
* Objective-C
* Objective-C++
* Perl
* Python
* Ruby
* Swift

You can ask for more, if you like.
